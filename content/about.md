### Hello!

I graduated with a computer science degree from Cornell University's College
of Engineering in 2019. I'm interested in applying high-level ideas from
programming language theory to low-level topics, like compilers, networks,
operating systems, or distributed systems. I enjoy leveraging type systems
and other static analyses to ensure correctness and improve performance.

For now, you can find me:

- Working as a software engineer for [Commure][com]
- Tinkering with side projects on [Github][gh]
- Practicing guitar and violin
- Bouldering, running, and playing volleyball
- Attending [Central Square Church][csc]

As for technical skills:

My preferred language is Rust. I am also proficient in OCaml, Java, and Python,
and have some knowledge of C, TypeScript, and JavaScript.
