### Hello!

I graduated with a computer science degree from Cornell University's College
of Engineering in 2019. I'm interested in applying high-level ideas from
programming language theory to low-level topics like compilers and operating
systems, and in leveraging type systems and other static analyses to ensure
correctness and improve performance.

For now, you can find me:

- Working on my PhD with [Emmett Witchel][ew]
- Tinkering with side projects on [Github][github]
- Practicing violin and guitar
- Bouldering, running, and playing volleyball
- Attending [Austin Chinese Church][acc]

As for technical skills:

My preferred language is Rust. I am also proficient in OCaml, Java, and Python,
and have some knowledge of C, TypeScript, and JavaScript.
