# Hello!

My name is Newton Ni.

I graduated with a computer science degree from Cornell University's College
of Engineering in 2019. I'm interested in applying high-level ideas from
programming language theory to low-level systems, like computer graphics or
networks. I enjoy programming, teaching, reading, and writing.

For now, you can find me:
- Working as a software engineer for [Commure][0]
- Tinkering with side projects on [Github][1]

As for technical skills,

I'm proficient in Rust, OCaml, Java, and Python,
and familiar with C, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
