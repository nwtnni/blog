**My name is Newton Ni.**

I'm a senior studying computer science at Cornell 
University. I'm interested in applying high-level ideas from
programming language theory to low-level systems, like
computer graphics or networks.

**For now, you can find me:**
- Working alongside [Nate Foster][1] on a compiler front-end for the [P4 network programming language][2]
- Teaching a discussion section for [CS 3110][3]
- Performing as part of the [Cornell Chamber Orchestra][4]
- Tinkering with side projects on [Github][5]

**As for technical skills,** 

I'm proficient in Java, Python, OCaml, and Rust, and familiar with C, Javascript,
HTML, and CSS.

**About this website:**

This website is hosted on Github Pages, using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I built the site up from scratch in HTML, using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
as a lighter responsive CSS framework, and then extending it in SASS. I
structured my directories according to 
[this guide](http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project),
to help keep the code extensible. There are two scripts in the head: one
called [prefix-free](https://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/) that adds
vendor prefixes to the CSS where necessary, and one Google analytics script.

All the source code can be found on Github.
