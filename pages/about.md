**My name is Newton Ni.**

I'm a junior studying engineering physics and computer science at Cornell 
University. My goal is to work at the interface between technology and 
medicine, leveraging first-hand experience to develop better software
for healthcare. Clinical data is growing at such a fast pace--there's a lot
of useful information buried underneath, and I hope to be there when
it's unearthed.

**For now, you can find me:**
- Teaching youth at my [local church](http://em.ficcc.org/){:target="_blank"}
- Analyzing genetic data with the [Sabuncu lab](http://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}
- Learning web development from [various online sources](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer){:target="_blank"}
- Performing as part of the [Cornell Symphony Orchestra](http://www.cuorchestra.org/){:target="_blank"}
- Tinkering with side projects on [Github](https://github.com/nwtnni){:target="_blank"}

**As for technical skills,** 

I'm proficient in Java and Python, and familiar with C, Javascript,
Ruby, HTML, and CSS.

**About this website:**

This website is hosted on Github Pages, using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I built the site up from scratch in HTML, using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/){:target="_blank"} 
as a lighter responsive CSS framework, and then extending it in SASS. I
structured my directories according to 
[this guide](http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project){:target="_blank"},
to help keep the code extensible. There are two scripts in the head: one
called [prefix-free](https://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/){:target="_blank"} that adds
vendor prefixes to the CSS where necessary, and one Google analytics script.

All the source code can be found on Github.
